## What is Blockchain
[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp), [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-blockchain/)

**My simplified definition:** Blockchain is a record of *immutable* transactions where each transaction is stored in a *block* and each block are *chained* to each other through their *hash* values.

Other words to consider: Ledger, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Peer-to-Peer, Decentralized
