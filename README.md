# Block Chain Self Learning

All of the [codes](https://github.com/Dixboi/BlockChainSelfLearning/tree/main/BlockChain) here will come from this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4). Although I literally copied the codes from this video, I tried to add some changes to enhance my learning.
