## What is Blockchain
[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp), [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-blockchain/)

**My simplified definition:** Blockchain is a record of *immutable* transactions where each transaction is stored in a *block* and each block are *chained* to each other through their *hash* values.

Other words to consider: Ledger, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Peer-to-Peer, Decentrali

## BlockChain

All of the codes on [BlockChain](https://github.com/Dixboi/Web3/tree/main/BlockChain) folder here will come from this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4). Although I literally copied the codes from this video, I tried to add some changes to enhance my learning.

<b>External imports to: </b><br>
  1. For the hash function: <code>npm install --save crypto-js</code>

<b>Short description about the videos:</b>
- First video: Genesis block, attributes of a block, adding blocks to the blockchain, validating a blockchain, and trying to tamper with the blockchain
- Second video: Difficulty to make it harder to add a block (this is also known as the proof-of-work)
- Third video: Added pending transactions for when blocks are not yet added, added Transaction class and can create transaction to be stored in pending transactions.
- Fourth video: Time stamp 10:35
- Fifth video: TBD

## CryptoZombie

Notes that I got when I am studying Solidity can be found [here](https://github.com/Dixboi/Web3/tree/main/CryptoZombies). The full courses of CryptoZombie can be found in this [link](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course)

<b>Short description from the courses:</b>
- Lesson 1: Will introduce the basic syntax of Solidity programming such as variable creation, contracts, function, variable types, and value returns for functions. <br>
